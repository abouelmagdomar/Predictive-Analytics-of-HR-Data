# Predictive-Analytics-of-HR-Data
Developed a predictive HR analytics tool using Python and machine learning tool such as NumPy, Pandas, Sci-kit Learn, and Matplotlib to forecast employee retention risks and productivity trends. Implemented advanced regression models—including linear regression, random forest, ridge, and lasso—to enhance predictive accuracy and streamline HR decision-making.

Translated business HR requirements into technical solutions, collaborating with both technical teams and business stakeholders to ensure model alignment and continuous improvement. Through data normalization, cleaning techniques, and feature engineering, Identified hidden workforce trends, providing actionable insights for workforce planning and employee retention strategies.

This project highlighted my expertise in machine learning, data analysis, and model optimization while demonstrating my ability to bridge the gap between technical implementation and business impact.
